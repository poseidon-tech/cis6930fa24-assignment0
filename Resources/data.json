She was due in court the next day for her parental rights case and was to be awarded custody of her children, but due to conflicting court documents it is unclear if she showed up. Ida had left her husband in March 1958 and was hospitalized soon after for various illnesses. As a result, her estranged husband placed their children in a boarding home and moved to Chicago while Ida was in the hospital. The state of Michigan took custody of the children and Ida had been fighting to get them back since she was released. Arrangements had been made for Ida and her children to fly to Florida to visit family after the September 19, 1958, court date but she did not show.

He was missing 10 teeth to include his two upper front teeth and there was evidence of a healed nasal fracture. The cause of death could not be determined; however, based on how the body was found this case is considered a homicide.

Prior to his disappearance, he sent a postcard to his aunt from New Orleans saying he was doing fine. He has never been heard from again.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Doran was known to hitchhike, traveling across the country from California to Florida. He was a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, an avid guitar player, and liked to write short stories and poetry. He also carried a small pocket Bible with him.
